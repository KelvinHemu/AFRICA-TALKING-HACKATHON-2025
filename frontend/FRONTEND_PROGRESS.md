# Construction Task Manager - Frontend Progress Summary

This document summarizes the frontend implementation completed so far, prior to integrating with backend services and making the application dynamic.

## Project Overview
The Construction Task Manager is a web application built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The frontend provides a dashboard and management interfaces for main tasks, sub-tasks, and artisans, with a consistent and modern UI.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dashboard
- Displays a summary and statistics of tasks.
- Shows a Task Completion card listing completed tasks by category, with clear formatting and badges.

### 2. Main Tasks Page
- Table of main construction tasks, with columns for task name, description, assigned engineer, status, and due date.
- Search, filter, advanced, and export options.
- "Add Main Task" button that opens a modal for task creation, including all relevant fields (title, description, engineer, dates, priority).

### 3. Sub Tasks Page
- Table of sub-tasks, showing sub-task title, associated main task, assigned artisan, status, and due date.
- Search and filter options.
- "Add Sub Task" button that opens a modal for sub-task creation, including fields for main task, title, description, artisan, due date, estimated hours, and required materials.

### 4. Artisans Page
- Table of artisans, with details like ID, name, phone number, specialty, active tasks, and status.
- Search, filter, and export options.
- "Add Artisan" button that opens a modal for registering a new artisan, including fields for name, phone, artisan ID, specialty, and years of experience.

### 5. Settings Page
- Tabbed settings interface with sections for General, Notifications, and Security.
- General: Company info, system preferences, and toggles.
- Notifications: Email and system notification preferences with toggles.
- Security: Password update form in a card layout.

### 6. UI/UX Consistency
- All modals use a light, semi-transparent overlay for a modern look.
- Responsive layouts and consistent styling using Tailwind CSS.
- Sidebar navigation with active state highlighting.

## Next Steps
- Integrate frontend with backend APIs to make data dynamic.
- Implement form submission, validation, and error handling.
- Add authentication and user management features as needed.

This summary captures the current state of the frontend implementation. All UI components and flows are in place, ready for dynamic integration.


## Backend Integration Steps

To connect the frontend with the backend (once pulled from GitHub), follow these steps:

1. **Pull Backend Code**
   - Clone or pull the backend repository from GitHub to your local environment.

2. **Review Backend Documentation**
   - Read the backend README and API docs for available endpoints, authentication, and usage instructions.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Create or update `.env.local` in the frontend with API base URLs and any required keys (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`).

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed for both frontend and backend (`npm install` or `yarn`).

5. **Run Backend Locally**
   - Start the backend server and verify it is accessible (typically at `http://localhost:<port>`).

6. **Update API Calls in Frontend**
   - Replace hardcoded/sample data with API calls using `fetch`, `axios`, or similar.
   - Example: Replace task lists with data fetched from `/api/tasks`, `/api/subtasks`, `/api/artisans`, etc.

7. **Implement CRUD Operations**
   - Connect forms and buttons to backend endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
   - Handle API responses and update UI accordingly.

8. **Handle Authentication (if required)**
   - Integrate login/logout and token storage if the backend uses authentication.
   - Protect routes and API calls as needed.

9. **Form Validation & Error Handling**
   - Add frontend validation for form inputs.
   - Display backend error messages to users.

10. **Testing**
    - Test all user flows to ensure frontend and backend are communicating correctly.
    - Fix any issues with data flow or error handling.

11. **Deployment**
    - Update environment variables for production.
    - Deploy both frontend and backend as required (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Heroku).

---

**Tip:**
- Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test backend endpoints independently before wiring up the frontend.
- Modularize API logic in the frontend for easier maintenance (e.g., create an `api/` or `services/` directory).
